TODO:

Define ros services:
- msg_name: pid_control_req, topic: pid_control, pkg: imu_reader, function: Receives vehicle yaw and returns vehicle velocities by performing PID control
	
	-> request 	: float32 yaw
	-> response : int32 FL_vel, FR_vel, BL_vel, BR_vel


To develop:
 - PID control for service
 - Arduino node 
 - Seed dispensing
 - Watering mechanism
 - Filter for yaw angle reading
 - No_seed / No_water / Stuck errors
 - Customized error exceptions


To test:
 - pid_control_req.srv is working

Tested: 
 - __pub_wheel_vel method
 - __set_goal_state
